# angular
Sample Angular application from Scratch 

app1 - completed application 
- search artists that are fetched from a json file using angular's http service , 
- also used angular's route - that routes the user to different partials based on the URL
- to run app1 - clone my angular repository and open angular/app1/index.html
app2 - still in the process (dont use this)
